            <h1 class="recipeTitle">Apple Bundt Cake with Butterscotch Glaze</h1>

            <h3 class="stepTitle">Ingredients: <i>The Cake</i></h3>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>2 cups of granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1½ cups of vegetable oil</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3 cups of AP flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>4 apples, peeled, cored, and finely diced</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="stepTitle">Ingredients: <i>The Glaze</i></h3>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 stick of unsalted butter</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                <li>Sifted confectioner’s sugar (about a cup)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="stepTitle">Preparation</h3>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Cream together the sugar, vegetable oil, and vanilla, then add eggs one at a time. Whisk dry ingredients together then add
                to your wet ingredients. Mix until just combined. Add apples by hand, folding with a rubber spatula. Scoop into a well greased bundt pan.  </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Bake at 350°F for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. While you are waiting for the cake to bake, make your butterscotch glaze. Put cream, sugar, butter, and salt in a small saucepan.
                Boil for about 3 minutes, whisking constantly, until the glaze is fairly thick. </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Allow the cake to cool briefly (I usually let mine sit for 5-10 minutes) before unmolding onto a cooling rack. Using a pastry brush, generously paint the glaze all over the bundt cake. I usually do this twice. Doing this while the cake
                is still quite warm allows for the glaze to be absorbed better. </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                I then take my leftover glaze and whisk it with some confectioner’s sugar to make a thick icing. If it’s too thick, you can
                always add some milk to thin it out. If it’s not thick enough, add more sifted confectioner’s sugar. I gently
                pour this over the top of the cake when it’s cool. </div>

            <h1 class="recipeTitle">Almond & Cardamom Pound Cake</h1>

            <h3 class="stepTitle">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan</li>
                <li>1 1/4 tsp. baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp. ground cardamom</li>
                <li>3/4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup crème fraîche plus more for serving</li>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                <li>3 large eggs, room temperature</li>
                <li>3/4 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp. almond extract</li>
                <li>1/4 cup sliced almonds</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour plus more for pan</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="stepTitle">Preparation</h3>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350°. Butter a 9x5x3” loaf pan; line bottom and long sides with a strip of
                parchment paper, leaving overhang. Butter parchment and dust pan with flour, tapping out any excess.
            </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Whisk baking powder, cardamom, salt, and 2 cups flour in a medium bowl; set aside. Whisk milk and ½ cup crème fraîche in
                a small bowl; set aside.
            </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat sugar and ¾ cup butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.
                Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend between additions and occasionally scraping down sides and bottom
                of bowl with a spatula, then add vanilla and almond extracts.
            </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Reduce speed to low and add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with crème fraîche mixture in 2 additions, beginning
                and ending with dry ingredients; beat just until combined. Scrape batter into prepared pan, smooth top, and
                sprinkle with sliced almonds.
            </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Bake cake, rotating halfway through, until golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 55–65 minutes.
                (Tent with foil if browning too quickly.)
            </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 15 minutes. Using parchment overhang, gently remove cake from pan and
                transfer to rack; let cool.
            </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Slice cake and serve with Tea-Poached Plums and crème fraîche.
            </div>
