            <h3 class="stepTitle">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan</li>
                <li>1 1/4 tsp. baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp. ground cardamom</li>
                <li>3/4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup crème fraîche plus more for serving</li>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                <li>3 large eggs, room temperature</li>
                <li>3/4 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp. almond extract</li>
                <li>1/4 cup sliced almonds</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour plus more for pan</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="stepTitle">Preparation</h3>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350°. Butter a 9x5x3” loaf pan; line bottom and long sides with a strip of parchment paper, leaving overhang. Butter parchment and dust pan with flour, tapping out any excess.
            </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Whisk baking powder, cardamom, salt, and 2 cups flour in a medium bowl; set aside. Whisk milk and ½ cup crème fraîche in a small bowl; set aside.
            </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat sugar and ¾ cup butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend between additions and occasionally scraping down sides and bottom of bowl with a spatula, then add vanilla and almond extracts.
            </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Reduce speed to low and add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with crème fraîche mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients; beat just until combined. Scrape batter into prepared pan, smooth top, and sprinkle with sliced almonds.
            </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Bake cake, rotating halfway through, until golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 55–65 minutes. (Tent with foil if browning too quickly.)
            </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 15 minutes. Using parchment overhang, gently remove cake from pan and transfer to rack; let cool.
            </div>

            <div class="recipeSteps">
                Slice cake and serve with Tea-Poached Plums and crème fraîche.
            </div>
