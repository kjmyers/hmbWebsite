                Hello friends!
            </div>

            <div class="blogBody">
                I hope this Sunday morning finds you happy and well. I’ve been in Denver for the past few days where I’ve walked up a mountain
                with a new friend, eaten the best fried chicken sandwich (not hyperbolic) at Stoweaway, and visited the art
                museum and botanic gardens. It’s been a very vacation-y type of vacation but I’ll tell you what… I must have
                acclimated really well to the below sea level swamps because this altitude has done a number on me. And I
                know! I’m not even that high up!

            </div>

            <div class="blogBody">
                Thank you for being here. Thank you for reading these words and sharing your thoughts. Thank you for being as kind and generous
                as you are. You’ll also see below that I’m headed to Detroit and Columbus at the end of the month and if
                you’re in or near those cities, we have a chance to say hello and hug!
            </div>

                Hello friends!
            </div>

            <div class="blogBody hideme">
                I spent a few days in Philadelphia last week (it’s been a minute since my last visit) and the city has exploded in overgrown
                green and off the shoulder dresses and just some very fine summer living. Good on ya, Philly. I thought seriously
                about bringing home some long hots (these are peppers) so I could make my own roast pork sandwiches in New
                Orleans. What stopped me was feeling self-conscious with a bunch of peppers on a plane, but as I sit here,
                back in New Orleans distinctly without long hots, I see the error of my ways.

            <div class="blogBody hideme">
                This coming week I’m off to Los Angeles and Denver for some solid work and play times. If you know a thing or two about Denver,
                I’d love your suggestions!
