                I grew up in a family of tremendous home bakers, but I’ll tell you what- there’s nothing you could tell 8 year old Joy to
                sway her from the indisputable fact that the best pies came dangerously hot, in a precisely folded paper
                container, filled with apple flavoring in a delightfully crisp crust from McDonald’s. The golden arches,
                where the cheeseburgers taste like candy in the most perplexing way. The pies, though! The pies were delicious
                and if I was lucky enough to have one, it meant that I likely also had french fries in my life so… clearly
                it was the best of days.

                I’ll tell you what’s so great about McDonad’s pies. They’re filled with… not exactly apples. They’re filled with what might
                be considered a spiced apple goop and a few strategic apple (?) pieces. Essentially the pies are just hot
                apple jelly inside of a pie crust and they were SO GOOD (albeit so hot you were taking your life in your
                hands with your first bite).

                I mention these apple pies because we can do better- and all it takes is good jam and pie crust. This is a recipe from earlier
                this year that I thought was worth revisiting for summer because we all need a quick dessert that’s as good
                as our childhood fast food dreams.

                We’ve talked a lot about pie crust. Incessantly, really. This recipe starts with a big batch of all-butter pie crust. The
                same recipe that makes a full pie, top and bottom crust, will make a ew dozen hand pies!
